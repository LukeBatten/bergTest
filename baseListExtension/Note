Some programs to pull the recent base lists, and convert them into root files
You will probably some requisites, such as ssconvert

run ./rootifyBaseList

After you run, there will be several useful files.
The main one being baseList.root, which contains 3 trees for each station type.

Current problems: 

> basesCampsRootifierA3.cxx will not completely rootify as the current spreadsheet uses '~' to denote
an approximation. This continues through to the csv files, which cannot be read too well by the rootifier.
>>> Potential solution: use sed to remove approximations!

> Many fields are empty... 
>>> Potential solution: fix this in the spreadsheet!
